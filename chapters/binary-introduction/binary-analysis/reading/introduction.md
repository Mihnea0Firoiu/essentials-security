# Introduction

Today's session aims to give you some tools to analyze a binary, in order to determine what that binary does and if it can hurt your system.

## Reminders

- code can't just be run;
it needs to be compiled and linked, becoming an executable
- the value of most symbols is placed in the binary file, in sections, and can be observed without actually running the executable
